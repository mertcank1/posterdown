# Introduction

Recently, CRISPR (Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats) is one of the most popular applications in the field of biology. CRISPR is a system that enhances the immune system against viral diseases and infections. In the target sequence (DNA), which is separated into specific clusters, off-target and on-target positions are determined by the matching between DNA and guide RNA. The spread and occurrence of viral diseases and infections are prevented by modifying the off-target bases (nucleotides). Off-target and on-target positions are evaluated based only on two categories with CFD/MIT scores. Instead of two classes, this study focuses on off-target positions. 

## **Objectives**

1. to identify the levels of off-target by using the latent class analysis.

2. According to the number of classes (Specification of Priors ), Bayesian Latent Class Analysis can be a more robust approach to predict the off-target levels.

3. to specify the off-target position in the genome for CRISPR.

# Methods

The main objective of latent class analysis (LCA) is to categorize individuals into groups within different populations exposed to a specific disease, based on their characteristics in public health and medicine. LCA is a method used to analyze the relationship between categorical variables measured at nominal and ordinal variables. In LCA, the maximum likelihood (ML) estimation method achieves the best solution by using the Expectation-Maximization (E-M) algorithm. Conversely, as an alternative to the ML method, the Bayesian estimation method is also utilized to estimate unknown parameters in latent class models through the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method. 

The dataset of the study was obtained from the CRISPOR database (http://crispor.tefor.net/). The analysis was conducted using a sample size of 5132, which included target sequences and gRNAs matching positions based on 23 bases. First of all, the matching of DNA and gRNA was encoded using binary (0/1) coding and multi (4x4 = 16) coding, considering that the combination of two bases in the same positions constitutes a variable. Subsequently, latent class analysis was applied separately for each encoding system. Bayesian latent class analysis was conducted, with the number of classes determined by the latent class analysis application. 

# Results

In binary and multi-category datasets, Lo-Mendel-Rubin (LMR) test results were found statistically significant for each latent class (p < 0.001). According to the Bayesian Information Criteria and the Consistent Akaike Information Criteria, the latent models were well-fitted to four classes for binary category datasets and three classes for multi-category datasets. Because the entropy values were higher than 0.60, the three and four latent class models were distinctly and deterministically classified. After determining class numbers, latent class models were estimated using the Bayesian approach with binary and multi-category datasets.

# Conclusion

Making too many changes to the bases in the DNA sequence can lead to a higher chance of developing another disease or weakening the immune system. This study systematically tested the impact of mismatches between the target sequence and guide RNA, laying the groundwork for minimizing base changes at each position. In the next stage, machine learning and deep learning algorithms may be used to predict the locations of multi-categorical off-target levels.In the next stage, machine learning and deep learning algorithms may be used to predict the locations of multi-categorical off-target levels.
